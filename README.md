We have integrated Gen3 with HPC (High Performance Computing)  to assist users in conducting high-speed computing at NCHC (National Center for High-Performance Computing, Taiwan). Our team refine the cloud deployment procedure that be provided from original Gen3 team , and also to adopt it into NCHC cloud service successfully. We also provide a light weight deployment solution under  docker compose environment to help scientists or service developer to evaluate Gen3. Through the data protection and sharing technology of Gen3, the HPC cluster can also access data and perform analysis. The relevant integration includes Private k8s, authentication integration, storage, computing, and more.
